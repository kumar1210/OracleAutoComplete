<Auto-Complete Application V1.0>
 This is an Auto-Complete application, which will take the users entered key from the console and return all the
 suggestions or words which contains the entered key. Here all the input data is getting loaded from a static txt file.

 <Application Manual>
 	1. Run the 'AutoCompleteSearch' class as a java application, since it contains the main method.
 	2. Go to the console and choose the suggested options.
 	3. Entering other than suggested options, will re-ask the user to choose from the given options.
 	4. Selecting '0' as an option will close the application.
 	5. Selecting '1' as an option, will reask the user to enter the 'key', for which all the words which contains the 
 	   entered key, will be displayed in the console.
 	   
 <Application Limitations and futuristic approach>
 	- Since this is an application which is running in server side and reading the input from the console. So user has to 
 	  press enter post entering his keyword(s).
 	- This can be upgraded to where we can built a front-end and give an option to the users to enter the keys and based
 	  on event listener, all the matching words can be returned.
